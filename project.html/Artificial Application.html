<p>Natural Language Generation: it’s a tool that produces text from the computer data. Currently used in customer service, report generation, and summarizing business intelligence insigh

<p>Virtual Agent: A Virtual Agentis a computer generated, animated, artificial intelligence virtual character (usually with anthropomorphic appearance) that serves as an online customer service representative. It leads an intelligent conversation with users, responds to their questions and performs adequate non-verbal behavior. An example of a typical Virtual Agent is Louise, the Virtual Agent of eBay, created by a French/American developer VirtuOz.</p>






<p>Machine Learning: Provides algorithms, APIs (Application Program interface) development and training toolkits, data, as well as computing power to design, train, and deploy models into applications, processes, and other machines. Currently used in a wide range of enterprise applications, mostly `involving prediction or classification.</p>





<p>Deep Learning Platforms: A special type of machine learning consisting of artificial neural networks with multiple abstraction layers. Currently used in pattern recognition and classification applications supported by very large data sets.</p>


<p>Robotic Process Automation: using scripts and other methods to automate human action to support efficient business processes. Currently used where it is inefficient for humans to execute a tas</p>


<p>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known technologies is IBM’s Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both, the doctor and the patients in the following ways:
  By providing a laboratory for the examination, representation and cataloguing medical information
  By devising novel tool to support decision making and research
  By integrating activities in medical, software and cognitive sciences
  By offering a content rich discipline for the future scientific medical communities.</p>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence in business: Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT con</p>


  <p>AI for robotics will allow us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging population and allow much longer independence. It will drastically reduce, may be even bring down traffic accidents and deaths, as well as enable disaster response for dangerous situations for example the nuclear meltdown at the fukushima power plant.</p>
