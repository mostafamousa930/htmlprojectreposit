    <td>Reactive Machines </td>
    <td>Reactive Machines perform basic operations. This level of A.I. is the simplest. These types react to some input with some output. There is no learning that occurs. This is the first stage to any A.I. system. A machine learning that takes a human face as input and outputs a box around the face to identify it as a face is a simple, reactive machine. The model stores no inputs, it performs no learning.

      Static machine learning models are reactive machines. Their architecture is the simplest and they can be found on GitHub repos across the web. These models can be downloaded, traded, passed around and loaded into a developer’s toolkit with eas</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Limited memory</td>
    <td>Limited memory types refer to an A.I.’s ability to store previous data and/or predictions, using that data to make better predictions. With Limited Memory, machine learning architecture becomes a little more complex. Every machine learning model requires limited memory to be created, but the model can get deployed as a reactive machine type.

      There are three major kinds of machine learning models that achieve this Limited Memory type:
      
      Reinforcement learning
      These models learn to make better predictions through many cycles of trial and error. This kind of model is used to teach computers how to play games like Chess, Go, and DOTA2.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Thery of Mind</td>
    <td>We have yet to reach Theory of Mind artificial intelligence types. These are only in their beginning phases and can be seen in things like self-driving cars. In this type of A.I., A.I. begins to interact with the thoughts and emotions of humans.

      Presently, machine learning models do a lot for a person directed at achieving a task. Current models have a one-way relationship with A.I. Alexa and Siri bow to every command. If you angrily yell at Google Maps to take you another direction, it does not offer emotional support and say, “This is the fastest direction. Who may I call and inform you will be late?” Google Maps, instead, continues to return the same traffic reports and ETAs that it had already shown and has no concern for your distress.
      
      A Theory of Mind A.I. will be a better companion.
      
      Fields of study tackling this issue include Artificial Emotional Intelligence and developments in the theory of Decision-Making. Michael Jordan presented some of his Decision-Making research at the May 13th event, The Future of ML and AI with Michael Jordan and Ion Stoica, and more coverage was presented at the ICLR 2020 conference.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Self Aware</td>
    <td>Finally, in some distant future, perhaps A.I. achieves nirvana. It becomes self-aware. This kind of A.I. exists only in story, and, as stories often do, instills both immense amounts of hope and fear into audiences. A self-aware intelligence beyond the human has an independent intelligence, and likely, people will have to negotiate terms with the entity it created. What happens, good or bad, is anyone’s guess.</td>
